FAQs
How many sources do I need?
For this exercise, you will be expected to engage in and show evidence of scholarly research by using at least two readings from the subject’s weekly set readings and at least two from the subject’s recommended readings. Using only recommended readings as your extra sources is acceptable, but you can also use more scholarly sources if needed. As this guide explains, you can use non-academic sources (e.g. news articles) but remember (a) these do not replace scholarly sources in your minimum research engagement, and (b) these need to be approached critically. As cultural studies scholars, we shouldn't take media reports or YouTube clips at face value. We must understand them as cultural artefacts and consider how they make meaning.
Can I just look at one example?
Yes, we largely recommend looking at one example. However, you can also look at more examples if you feel something interesting comes from looking at them side-by-side. For example, they may contrast with one another (i.e. have different viewpoints on an issue), or they may be surprisingly similar (i.e. they may share some presuppositions, despite appearing to be different). So, one example is excellent as it allows you to go in-depth. If you're using more than one example, you need to spend time analysing the two (or more) examples and how they relate to one another.
Can I include pictures or photos?
Yes, you can if you want. You don’t have to, but if you think you aren’t able to make your argument without including a visual source, then feel free to include it. Ensure you cite your visual sources correctly, just like text sources!
Do I have to pick an example for my essay, or can I just talk about the theory?
Yes, you must use an example. The example will help you work through the theoretical and conceptual material we have studied this semester. In general, we have found that your cultural studies essay will always be stronger if you provide examples that demonstrate your argument and understanding of the readings.
Tips for success
Engage deeply with sources: Make sure to not just cite, but critically engage with at least two set readings and two recommended readings.
Focus on recent examples: As suggested, use examples from 2022-2024 to avoid extensive historical, contextual explanation.
Develop a clear argument: Ensure your essay has a strong, well-supported thesis that directly addresses the chosen question.
Use examples effectively: Incorporate specific cultural artefacts or practices to illustrate your theoretical points.
Practice proper citation: Familiarise yourself with MLA style. and cite all sources correctly, including visual ones if used.
